# SoftwareTesting_IN_C
A basic testing program in C. In many computer science and engineering research projects, researchers are working with information about a set of entities and the relations between them. For instance, the set of entities may be the set of classes in a software system, and the relations may be inheritance, aggregation etc.
Compile the C program with your favourite C compilier

*quit - The program must exit.*

*setdb inputfile.txt*
##To print all relations please note that , you must use **setdb** before doing any queries like _**printdb inputfile.txt**_  

If **inputfile.txt** can be opened for reading, your program must read from the database file, and determine the number of lines in it. It must then output a message such as

*Read 54 facts from inputfile.txt*

If the database file could not be opened for reading, your program must respond

*Unable to read from inputfile.txt*
